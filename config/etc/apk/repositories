# We don't have the boot media configured here, which is deliberate.
#
# During boot, /media/cdrom/apks is set as the only repo in this file.
#
# During the boot process, the live media uses that repo to seed
# packages specified by /etc/apk/world into the running system.
#
# From that point onwards though, we layer the apkovl on top
# of the filesystem, which includes this file, and gives us access
# to web-based repositories.
