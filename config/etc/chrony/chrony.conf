# When the chronyd daemon is initially started, it is possible that the system
# clock is considerably in error. Attempting to correct such an error by
# slewing might not be sensible, since it might take several hours to correct
# the error by this means.
#
# The purpose of the initstepslew directive is to allow chronyd to make a
# rapid measurement of the system clock error at boot time, and to correct the
# system clock by stepping before normal operation begins. Since this would
# normally be performed only at an appropriate point in the system boot
# sequence, no other software should be adversely affected by the step.
#
# I add some IPs here because we make the assumption that we're on a system that
# can't resolve any domain names temporarily due to the clock being out of sync.
