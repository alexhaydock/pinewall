# Configuration for /etc/init.d/rngd

# This is based on Alpine's default config from the rng-tools-openrc
# with only the HWRNG_DEVICE variable changed (for Raspberry Pi support).

# Hardware RNG config, uncommented to enable the hwrng on the Pi 4
# (We don't need to load any kernel modules to enable this RNG on
# the Pi 4 it seems, but we may on older devices).
HWRNG_DEVICE="/dev/hwrng"

# Defaults which are unchanged from the default config
