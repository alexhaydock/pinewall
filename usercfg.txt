# Add a base overclock out of the box. This has been tested not
# to cause any issues on my open air cooled setup without fan
# or heatsink and ought to be fine to apply on mostly any Pi 4.
#
# Set the max CPU freq to 1.8GHz (Pi 4 default is 1.5GHz)
arm_freq=1800
#
# Apply a 0.05v voltage increase (this is a decimal value
# and each increment corresponds to a 0.025v step above the
# Pi's base voltage).
#
# I've disabled this for now as we might not need it. It
# seems that the Pi Foundation have validated all Pi 4
# models for 1.8GHz as a stable base frequency.

# See: https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/bullseye-bonus-1-8ghz-raspberry-pi-4/

# Disable 'Turbo' frequencies and allow us to sit at our arm_freq
# value continuously. This will use more power but lower
# overall system latency, which is fairly desirable for a
# system acting as a router.
